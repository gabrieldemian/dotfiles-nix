# hosts

A `host` is a machine. Each host define their own configuration for hardware and software, hosts use custom and official packages, modules, etc. 

The host home-manager entrypoint is called `home.nix`.

Code that is specific for only one host (not shared), will be located in it's own folder.

`hosts/Nixos` is my main machine for personal use.
